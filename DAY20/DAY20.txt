DAY 20 --> Setting up C++ 

#
As on DAY 19, I have successfully scored up 5* in Java on HackerRank.
So, let's give a try to other programming language like c++ and python since every programming language requires the same approach to solve a problem most often.
The problem solving scenario remains the same in most cases.

This week I would be trying to practice question in C++ or Python on HackerRank
Let's see what we get at the end of this week.

#Program Completed
