##Comments
--> // For single line Comments
--> /*.....*/ for multi line Comments
--> Comments are not visible in the output.

##Do while
--> Iterate throgh a group of statement until the specified condition.

##Arrays
--> Used to store a list of values.
--> for example int[3] refer to a memory which can hold upto 3 bytes of space.
--> {} can be used to define an Arrays 

##MultiDimensional Arrays
--> Collection of 1-D Arrays
--> int[4][3] is basic syntax for a 2-D array where 4 is the number of sub arrays and 
3 is the length of each sub arrays
--> Do not omit the first parameter in defining multi dimensional array like: double[][2] it results error.
