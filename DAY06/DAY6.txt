## .eqauls() methods V/S ==
--> equal operator(==) check whether two objects points to the same reference rather than looking for the data.
--> .eqauls() methods check whether two instances contains the same data or not even when they both points to different references.
--> == is used mostly for primitives.


## Abstract classes
--> These are used to maintain a hierarchy of classes with many different sub classes.
--> abstract classes can't be instantized as compared to regular classes.
--> Also one abstract class can be extends with another class as to maintain hierarchy.
