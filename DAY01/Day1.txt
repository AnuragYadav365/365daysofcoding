DAY 1 --> Variables and Strings

#Defining Variables
-->The eight primitives defined in Java are int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean, and char.

--> short is of 16bit whereas long is of 64bit.
--> short of double is float, and when declaring float variable add the 'f' termination at the end of value.


#Defining Strings
--> String is a non-primitve datatype in Java.
--> String is a class in java
--> Using concatenate "+", add two strings.
--> \n is special character used for new line.

$Note - Use single quotes for literal char s, double quotes for literal String s.


#While Loop
--> Used for conditional analysis.
--> Need to update the value (as it results in inifinte loop)
--> Works on TRUE/FALSE condition of particular statement.

#For Loop
--> Must have two semicolon as in arguments (;;)
--> This format of for loop "for(;;)" would always output a True value

#Format specifiers
--> Replace a specified value in string arguments via a variable value on runtime.
--> %d is for specifying an int format specifier.
--> %n for a new line
--> %f for a decimal float value
--> %c for character
--> %b for Boolean


#Note
--> i= i+1 is same as i++
--> != is symbol for not equal

#If Condition/ statement
--> If is based upon condition evaluation of any expression or value.
--> We can use elif(many time), else(only one occurence) with if statement.

#User input
--> Firsly, we have to import the package which can be done by: import java.util.Scanner
--> Scanner is also a class like String.
--> nextline() method is used for checking the new line chatacter that is enter key input.

#Programm Coded
$$$ Designed prim_dtype file whihc include demonstration of primtives used in Java $$$
$$$ Program that concatenates two strings and two values of different primitives(int + double) $$$
$$$ Program that shows the usage of while loop and implements the mathematical table calculation of any number $$$
$$$ Program that prints the values from 1 to 10 using for loop $$$
$$$ Program for displaying strings and different values using format specifiers $$$
$$$ Design a program that checks for 365 days of streak (using if and loop) $$$
$$$ Program that takes string input from user and display the same $$$
