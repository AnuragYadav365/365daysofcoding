DAY 4 --> Constructors and this vs. this()

##Constructors
--> Constructors do not have return types.
--> A constructor name should always be the same as that of class.
--> Constructors are different from methods because of the return value features.
--> Parameter can also be added inside constructor declaration like methods.

## this.
--> this. is used to differentiate between the variable of instance of the class and other 
variables inside the scope

## this()
--> Used to call a constructor within another constructor
--> must be at the beginning of the constructor.
--> cannot call two constructors within one constructor

## Static variables and methods
--> Static variables have only one copy inside whole class
--> These are called before constructors or non-static variables and methods.
--> Declared by keyword "static"
--> Can be used for counting of objects inside a class

## Final
--> Constant creators which helps in declaring final value of a whole class.
--> Their value can't be changed once specified.
