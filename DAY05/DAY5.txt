DAY 5 --> Inheritance, Access Modifiers, Polymorphism

## Inheritance
--> Inheriting the objects and methods from another class.
-->  "extends" keyword can also be used to extends a class with another class

For example:
public class C1 extends C2  --> here C1 is a sub class and C2 is the super class


## Access Modifiers
--> public, private, default (lack of access modifiers) and private.

## Polymorphism
--> Polymorphism means many forms of the same function or instance.
--> functions with the same name in different classes creates polymorphism

## Note --> Learn about polymorphism more

## Numeric casting
--> You can cast a value of one primitive to another one via type casting.
--> For example, you can cast a float value into an int value.
--> String to int or vice versa would not work.

##Interfaces
--> Interfaces are another thing after the class
--> they include methods which are must in any other implemented classes.
--> implements keyword is used to establish relation between class file and Interfaces
--> also we can implement more than one interfaces unlike extends(only one class)


----------------------------------BREAK TIME------------------------------------

##Anonymous class
--> these can be used to modify structure of class as well as interfaces
--> used in place on declaration of instances

##Reading text from a file
--> Via using file library of java we can read file
--> and with the help of Scanner class we can manipulate the data and display it.
